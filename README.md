## Blog Red Hat Transition Year programme April 2024

Monday, 22nd April 

The first day of the Red Hat TY programme started off with a warm welcome and a few ice breakers. Afterwards we got a tour of the office by Becky. 
I can already say that I love the atmosphere of the office and the way that everybody is treated equally and rightfully. I very much appreciate the way we are treated as every other office worker or intern. The week here surely will be great and enjoyable.
The afternoon was mainly consisting out of an workshop on teamwork skills and methods. That wasn’t something I expected to experience at a technology and coding company so I was very surprised but also impressed. The workshop was very interesting and helpful. 
First we were talking bout an agile (adaptable to change and constant improvement) mindset and how it affects the creation of a product. We learned about how it is way more effective to bring a customer along while designing and creating a product instead of leaving the customer behind.

In conclusion I very much liked the first day of the Red Hat TY module and Red Hat as a company itself.  I’m looking forward to the next few days and can’t wait on what else we’re going to learn here.

At 10am we started off with a workshop on Git. That workshop was really confusing at first and I still don't completly understand what exactly we did, but the members of staff did their best to explain it and did a good job. I enjoyed that workshop since it was challenging but I'd still need a good explenation of what is actually happening when you enter all those commands. 
In the afternoon we had a workshop on Micro bit and Makey Makey, which was very fun and intersting since we just got to experiment whith both of them. I really enjoyed the second day. 


Wednesday, 24th April

We spend the most time on Wednesday learning to work, create and problemsove as a team. The task was to built a rollercoaster out of different materials like straws, tape, boxes and foil. It was very cool at first, we had many ideas and tired a few different prototypes. Arond lunchtime when everything started to fail or fall apart, the motivaiton was pretty low. We got back on track in the afternoon. The afternoon was very fun and relaxing, less competitive and stressful. 
The most difficoult task for the building was probably the loop, it was very hard to get the momentum, speed and gravity to be exactly right for the ball to actually go through the loop and into th funnel we buil at the end. The most difficoult task as a team was to stick with what we managed to create, not give up and not be too frustrated at on another. I feel like this was a crisis that made it possible for us to actually work and think as a team. I got to know the other teo members of my time very well and I really enjoyed working with them. 

In between of the rollercoaster work we had some ineresting talks, one on AI and three on student live/ woman in IT. Bot of them were really enjoyable. Tha AI one was particullary interesting since it help me to gain a general understanding of what AI actually is and how it is developed. I still couldn't understand all of the topics mentioned but I think I got the basics. The other three talks were really interesting as well. I founf it fascianting how many differnt paths to the same career exist. 

Day three was just as enjoyable as Day two and one. I'm looking forward to the next two days, but I already know that this is the best work experience I've experienced so far.
