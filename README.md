## Blog Red Hat Transition Year programme April 2024

Monday, 22nd April 

The first day of the Red Hat TY programme started off with a warm welcome and a few ice breakers. Afterwards we got a tour of the office by Becky. 
I can already say that I love the atmosphere of the office and the way that everybody is treated equally and rightfully. I very much appreciate the way we are treated as every other office worker or intern. The week here surely will be great and enjoyable.
The afternoon was mainly consisting out of an workshop on teamwork skills and methods. That wasn’t something I expected to experience at a technology and coding company so I was very surprised but also impressed. The workshop was very interesting and helpful. 
First we were talking bout an agile (adaptable to change and constant improvement) mindset and how it affects the creation of a product. We learned about how it is way more effective to bring a customer along while designing and creating a product instead of leaving the customer behind.

In conclusion I very much liked the first day of the Red Hat TY module and Red Hat as a company itself.  I’m looking forward to the next few days and can’t wait on what else we’re going to learn here.

At 10am we started off with a workshop on Git. That workshop was really confusing at first and I still don't completly understand what exactly we did, but the members of staff did their best to explain it and did a good job. I enjoyed that workshop since it was challenging but I'd still need a good explenation of what is actually happening when you enter all those commands. 
In the afternoon we had a workshop on Micro bit and Makey Makey, which was very fun and intersting since we just got to experiment whith both of them. I really enjoyed the second day.
